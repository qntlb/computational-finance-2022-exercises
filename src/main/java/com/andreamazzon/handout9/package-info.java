/**
 * In this package we work with the specification of:
 * - the measure under which we simulate the processes modelling
 * the evolution of Libors 
 * - the dynamics of these processes (log-normal or normal).
 * We also have a theoretical exercise about the valuations of caplet
 * for when the underlying processes follow displaced log-normal dynamics.
