/**
 * This package contains the code for the solution of the exercises of the first
 * handout. In particular, we look at the simulation of a Brownian motion
 * and at the pricing of options using the Finmath library. You also find a PDF
 * with the solution of the exercise about interest rates, a short note about
 * asset-or-nothing options and also the schemes (from last semester) of the
 * Finmath library structure for the simulation of asset prices.
